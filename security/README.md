This is the directory with the secuity scans we run against https://GDI.foundation.


At the GDI.foundation we have these classification levels

- GDI TOP SECRET (GTS) is only accessible the GDI Board members on request with requires clearance from the chairman.
- GDI SECRET (GS) is only accessible to GDI Board members and does not require clearance from the chairman.
- GDI CONFIDENTIAL (GC) is accessible to the members
- GDI RESTRICTED (GR) is available to the members, volunteers but not to the public (yet).

We don't believe in security through obscurity so the security scans on our own infratstructure should be publicly avaialble.

If you do find a vulnerability then please reach out to us.
