This is the directory with the security scans we run against https://GDI.foundation.


At the GDI.foundation we have these classification levels

- GDI TOP SECRET (GTS) is only accessible the GDI Board members on request which requires clearance from the chairman.
- GDI SECRET (GS) is only accessible to GDI Board members and does not require clearance from the chairman.
- GDI CONFIDENTIAL (GC) is accessible to the members
- GDI RESTRICTED (GR) is available to the members, volunteers but not to the public (yet).
- GDI PUBLIC (GP) is publicly available.

We don't believe in security through obscurity so the security scans on our own infrastructure should be publicly available.
If you do find a vulnerability then please reach out to us.
