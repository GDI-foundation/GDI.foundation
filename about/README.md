# About

## GDI.Foundation is a nonprofit organisation.
Our mission is to defend the free & open Internet by trying to make it safer.
We address security issues with responsible disclosure ([coordinated vulnerability disclosures](https://www.iso.org/standard/45170.html)).

#### What do we stand for?
We believe that actions must be taken to protect the freedom of communication through the Internet. This is our [mission statement](/mission/).

#### What do we do?
We detect & analyse high risk "criminal" opportunities, share the risk & vulnerabilities with everybody, inform the ones who are at risk and give free advice about a solution. A few of our operations were covered in the [news](/news/).

#### Are you making a profit?
No, we are a [nonprofit foundation](https://github.com/GDI-foundation/GDI.foundation/blob/master/archive/GDI%20Foundation%20%7C%20ANBI.pdf). We rely on contributions in the form of donations, sponsorships and participating members

### How do you operate?
The GDI foundation aims to support a global community of security experts who are willing to contribute to the [mission](https://gdi.foundation/#/mission/README) of the GDI.foundation to protect the free and open internet by trying to make it safer and by thus guarding the well-being of humans online, to ensure respect for all human intellectual freedom, and to prevent and mitigate digital abuse. As a result, our chapters are designed to be inclusive, open, collaborative, and enjoyable for all volunteers. This is our  [Code of Conduct](https://gdi.foundation/#/about/Code_of_Conduct.md) which explains the expectations of everyone involved.
