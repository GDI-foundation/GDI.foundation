# Outlook 2019

## Looking back
We have come a long way. The GDI foundation was originally founded in December 2015 and kicked off 2016 with [PROJECT366](https://twitter.com/GDI_FDN/status/816581294134034432). In 2017 we grew in numbers with volunteers and members dealing with the victims of huge ransack attacks on open databases systems and the fallout of Eternalblue. 
Thanks to our volunteers we could help big Digital Service Providers, Internet Service providers but also huge brands, banks, and financial services, defensive industries, cable and telecommunications, food retailing, healthcare, and companies involved in the distribution of clothes, food, and energy protecting their operations by finding easy to find weaknesses in their external systems.

## Our biggest success
Currently we are are actively tracking over 33 and half million detected vulnerabilities in the world. And on 1 September 2018, we have reported over a half million vulnerabilities in only eight months of 2018. As far as we know, there is no other (non)-profit organization in the world who has such results. The GDI.foundation did more Responsible Disclosure than all the big known bug bounty programs in the world combined.

## Our biggest struggle
Although we are increasing in numbers in all aspects, we need to start adding more depth. 
At this moment the GDI.foundation can be described as a very AD HOC organization. Although our [mission](https://gdi.foundation/mission/) is straightforward and clear. Our operational “excellence” and our non-critical additional things (like our website, twitter etc.) is not up to par. And we need more people on board (as in board members) who can help bring focus and depth in all areas of the GDI.foundation.

## Looking forward
The organisation will expand to six pillars which will help achieve our main goal of handling vulnerabilities. 
In 2019 the GDI.foundation will start providing unique intelligence and Human Validated OSINT to trusted partners.

Every pillar will have their own board member to help speed up internal decision making.
