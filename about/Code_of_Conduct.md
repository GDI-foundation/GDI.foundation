# Code of Conduct
The GDI foundation aims to support a global community of security experts who are willing to contribute to the [mission](https://gdi.foundation/#/mission/README) of the GDI.foundation to protect the free and open internet by trying to make it safer and by thus guarding the well-being of humans online, to ensure respect for all human intellectual freedom, and to prevent and mitigate digital abuse.  As a result, our chapters are designed to be inclusive, open, collaborative, and enjoyable for all volunteers.

This Code of Conduct explains the expectations of everyone involved, and it applies to all activities and all online events such as video and voice calls, mailing lists, chat channels, and social media. The code of conduct describes the types of behavior we do and do not support. The same behaviors are expected from individuals representing the GDI foundation.

## Expected Behavior
It is expected that participants behave properly and positively at all times. Participants should show respect and courtesy to others and help ensure a safe and inclusive environment.

The following behaviors are expected and requested of all volunteers:
* Participate authentically and actively. In doing so, you contribute to the health and longevity of the GDI foundation.
* Exercise consideration and respect in your speech and actions.
* Attempt collaboration before conflict.
* Refrain from demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behavior and speech.
* Be mindful of your surroundings and of your fellow participants. Alert chapter leaders or board members if you notice a dangerous situation, someone in distress, or violations of this Code of Conduct.
* Remember that projects and operational results may be shared with members of the public; please be respectful to all parties involved.
* Be respectful of other opinions even if you don't share them.

All volunteers should feel welcome and comfortable to participate fully; therefore, we are committed to providing an environment free of the following unacceptable behaviors:

* Discrimination of any kind. Some examples include, but are not limited to, discrimination based on a person's race, ethnicity, culture, national origin, social or economic class, educational level, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, physical appearance, age, size, family status, political belief, religion, or mental or physical ability.
* Harassment, including offensive speech, xenophobia, antisemitism, islamophobia, threats or demands, sharing of sexualized media, stalking, or unwelcome physical contact or sexual attention. Harassment also includes slights and negative messages, regardless of intent, based solely on appearance (sometimes called microaggressions) in person or social media.
* Misbehavior includes disturbance to others or event proceedings, misuse of property, trespass, theft, or other antisocial acts.
* Disrespecting confidentiality, e.g., not adhering to [Traffic Light Protocol](https://gdi.foundation/#/traffic-light-protocol/README.md) (TLP)  labels or posting confidential information outside the intended audience.
* Violence, threats of violence, or violent language directed against another person.
* Sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist, or otherwise discriminatory jokes and language.
* Posting or displaying sexually explicit, violent, or otherwise derogatory material.
* Posting or threatening to post other people's personally identifying information ("doxing").
* Personal insults, particularly those related to gender, sexual orientation, race, religion, or disability.
* Inappropriate photography or recording
* Inappropriate physical contact. You should have someone's consent before touching them.
* Unwelcome sexual attention. This includes sexualized comments or jokes, inappropriate touching, groping, and unwelcome sexual advances.
* Deliberate intimidation, stalking or following (online or in-person).
* Sustained disruption of community events, including talks and presentations.
* Disrespecting expected local behavior.
* Advocating for or encouraging any of the above behavior.

## Consequences
* Unacceptable behavior by any volunteer, including those with decision-making authority, will not be tolerated. Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately.
* The GDI foundation expects that breaches of this Code of Conduct can be resolved informally. However, suppose a volunteer engages in unacceptable behavior. In that case, we may take any action deemed appropriate, including a temporary ban or permanent expulsion from the GDI foundation.
* The GDI foundation reserves the right to ban a volunteer or participant violating this Code of Conduct from future GDI.foundation activities, which will be made as a decision by the GDI Foundation Board, or by an independent body identified and entrusted by the GDI Foundation Board with the task.

Reporting Guidelines
If you are subject to or witness unacceptable behavior or have any other concerns, please notify a chapter leader as soon as possible or email coc@gdi.foundation. If one of the chapter leaders is a potential offender or subject of the report, he will remove him or herself from the investigation.

Addressing Grievances
Suppose you feel you have been falsely or unfairly accused of violating this Code of Conduct. In that case, you should notify the GDI Foundation via board@gdi.foundatiopn or any board member personally with a concise description of your grievance.
