## Current status
At this moment were setting up our GCERT in the [Netherlands](https://GCERT.NL) and the [Global-CERT here](https://GCERT.GLOBAL). Moreover, in the meantime, we work on the [new organization](#outlook-2019), gathering a big group of enthusiast, passioned professionals to help GDI reach the next the level. We are currently moving our entire infrastructure to a new secure platform. We are also interviewing several talented and enthusiastic people for several board member positions and run an election for selecting a new chair, vice-chair, treasurer and secretary from our members as we steadily go forward. In the next three months will be setting the [GCERT](https://github.com/GCERT) which make us more efficient in handling vulnerabilities and provide a systematic response facility to computer security threats and (online) incidents.
## Can I help?
Yes. We have many [issues and missing features](https://github.com/GDI-foundation/website/issues/) regarding our website.
However, we also have new (research) [projects](https://github.com/GDI-foundation/website/projects/) planned to which you are welcome to contribute. We are accepting new (board)members, volunteers, and contributing partners.

## Mission statement
### What is the GDI foundation
The GDI foundation is an international humanitarian non-profit organization which is being operated by 34 members. Our mission is to protect the free and open Internet by trying to make it safer and by thus guarding the well-being of humans online, to ensure respect for all human intellectual freedom, and to prevent and mitigate digital abuse. We address security issues with Responsible Disclosures and assist anywhere in times of need.

The GDI foundation is a non-profit organization founded in 2015 in The Hague, The Netherlands, by Victor Gevers and Vincent Toms.

The committee has a sworn oath under the international humanitarian law to protect the life and dignity of anyone online who is at risk.

### Humanity
The GDI foundation, born of a desire to bring assistance without discrimination to those online at risk being vulnerable for online attacks, endeavors, in its international and national capacity, to prevent and alleviate human suffering wherever it may be found. Its purpose is to protect life and health and to ensure respect for the human being. It promotes mutual understanding, friendship, cooperation, sharing knowledge amongst all people.

### Impartiality
The GDI foundation does not discriminate as to nationality, race, religious beliefs, class or political opinions.  We are here to detect, prevent and help mitigate vulnerable issues,  guided solely by their needs, and to give priority to the most urgent cases of distress.

### Neutrality
To continue to enjoy the confidence of all, the GDI foundation may not take sides in hostilities or engage at any time in controversies of a political, racial, religious or ideological nature.

### Independence
The GDI foundation independent. In providing these humanitarian services we are subject to the laws of their respective countries, must always maintain their autonomy so that they may be able at all times to act by the mission of the GDI foundation.

### Voluntary Service
The GDI foundation is an online voluntary auxiliary organization not prompted or driven in any manner by desire for (a financial) gain.

### Unity
There can be only one GDI foundation chapter per country. It must be open to all. It must carry on our primary mission throughout its territory but is not bound to it as members can be member of the GCERT.

### Universality
The GDI foundation, in which all societies have equal status and share similar responsibilities and duties in helping each other, is worldwide.

## Code of Conduct
This is our code of conduct. We kept it simple. Just *Be Excellent to Each Other*.
[![Code of Conduct: “Be Excellent to Each Other“](httsp://img.youtube.com/vi/QGErt4CfLD0/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGErt4CfLD0 "Code of Conduct: “Be Excellent to Each Other“")


#### ** Outlook **
## Outlook 2019
### Looking back
We have come a long way. The GDI foundation was originally founded in December 2015 and kicked off 2016 with [PROJECT366](https://twitter.com/GDI_FDN/status/816581294134034432). In 2017 we grew in numbers with volunteers and members dealing with the victims of [huge ransack attacks on open databases systems](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/au/security/news/cybercrime-and-digital-threats/hacking-groups-attack-more-than-20-thousand-mongodb-databases) and the [fallout of Eternalblue](https://www.nu.nl/internet/4820652/negenduizend-nederlandse-bedrijven-dichten-serverlek-melding-onderzoeker.html). 
Thanks to our volunteers we could help big Digital Service Providers, Internet Service providers but also huge brands, banks, and financial services, defensive industries, cable and telecommunications, food retailing, healthcare, and companies involved in the distribution of clothes, food, and energy protecting their operations by finding easy to find weaknesses in their external systems.

### Our biggest success
Currently we are are actively tracking over 33 and half million detected vulnerabilities in the world. And on 1 September 2018, we have reported over a half million vulnerabilities in only eight months of 2018. As far as we know, there is no other (non)-profit organization in the world who has such results. The GDI.foundation did more Responsible Disclosures than [all the big known bug bounty programs in the world combined](https://twitter.com/martenmickos/status/1006160947965095936). 

### Our biggest struggle
Although we are increasing in numbers in all aspects, we need to start adding more depth. 
At this moment the GDI.foundation can be described as a very AD HOC organization. Although our [mission](#mission-statement) is straightforward and clear. Our operational “excellence” and our non-critical additional things (like our website, twitter etc.) is not up to par. And we need more people on board (as in [board members](https://gdi.foundation/about/board_members/)) who can help bring focus and depth in all areas of the GDI.foundation.

### Looking forward
The organisation will expand with six pillars [divisions] which will help achieve our main goal of handling vulnerabilities. 
In 2019 the GDI.foundation will start providing *Unique Intelligence* and *Human Validated OSINT* to trusted partners. 

This is how we set up our divisions
<img src="https://gdi.foundation/about/organization _chart.svg" alt="GDI.foundation organizational chart" />

Every *division* will have their own [board member](https://GDI.foundation/about/2018-2019_Board_Member_Candidates/) to help speed up internal decision making, coordination and supporting the volunteers.

* [GCERT](#gcert)
* [PROJECTS](#projects)
* [RESEARCH](#research)
* [PROGRAMS](#programs)
* [EDUCATION](#education)
* [PARTNERSHIPS](#partnerships)


### [GCERT](#gcert)
Our goal for 2019 is to move our ad hoc approach to more advanced incident handling with our new GCERT as we trying to raise the bar to become an international trusted computer incident response teams who cooperatively handle computer security incidents and promote incident prevention programs even better than we did before. The GCERT division will have a [GCERT.global](https://gcert.global/) annd a [GCERT.NL](https://gcert.nl). The Dutch GCERT will be focuissing on handeling vulnerabilities in the Netherlands.

### [PROJECTS](#projects)
A few of our projects will be made open source. As a non-profit organization which is driven by volunteers, we firmly believe in the collective power of a community of talented individuals working together delivers not only more ideas but quicker development and troubleshooting when issues arise. This is why moved our PROJECTS directly to Github.
We want to provide more transparency on how GDI.foundation works and invite others to contribute to our mission. To achieve this goal contributor will get full visibility into the code base, as well as all the proposals, issues and bugs.

### [EDUCATION](#education)
To be able to participate in the activitties of the GDI.foundation a certain form a basic knowledge is required. The GDI.foundation will offer the free education needed to its volunteers/

### [PROGRAMS](#programms)
The programs division will be focussing on special activities (like personal developement guidance) for our volunteers. This will go hand in hand with *education* division. 

### [RESEARCH](#research)
The research division will be focussing on improving the quality of our research.

And this is how it is all going to fit and work together
