At this moment were setting up our GCERT in the [Netherlands](https://GCERT.NL) and the [Global-CERT here](https://GCERT.GLOBAL).

#### Can I help?
Yes. We have many [issues and missing features](https://github.com/GDI-foundation/website/issues/) regarding our website.
However, we also have new (research) [projects](https://github.com/GDI-foundation/website/projects/) planned to which you are welcome to contribute. We are accepting new (board)members, volunteers, and contributing partners.

#### Our current status
We are currently moving our entire infrastructure to a new secure platform. We are also interviewing several talented and enthusiastic people for several board member positions and run an election for selecting a new chair, vice-chair, treasurer and secretary from our members as we steadily go forward. In the next three months will be setting the [GCERT](https://github.com/GCERT) which make us more efficient in handling vulnerabilities and provide a systematic response facility to computer security threats and (online) incidents.

You can still reach us via GCERT[at]GDI.foundation.
