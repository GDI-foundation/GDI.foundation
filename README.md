#### GDI.Foundation is a nonprofit organization. 
Our mission is to defend the free & open Internet by trying to make it safer.
We address security issues with responsible disclosure ([coordinated vulnerability disclosures](https://www.iso.org/standard/45170.html)).

#### What do we stand for?
We believe that actions must be taken to protect the freedom of communication through the Internet. This is our [mission statement](https://gdi.foundation/mission/).

#### What do we do?
We detect & analyze high risk "criminal" opportunities, share the risk & vulnerabilities with everybody, inform the ones who are at risk and give free advice about a solution. A few of our operations were covered in the [news](https://www.google.nl/search?q=GDI.foundation&num=100&tbs=sbd:1&tbm=nws&tbas=0&source=lnt&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi4sMS66qvdAhXGIlAKHdTxC-MQpwUIHw&biw=1440&bih=803&dpr=2).

We have saved our previous publications [here](https://github.com/GDI-foundation/website/tree/master/archive).

#### Are we making a profit?
No, we are a nonprofit foundation. We rely on contributions in the form of donations, sponsorships and participating members

#### Can I help?
Yes. We have a lot of [issues and missing features](https://github.com/GDI-foundation/website/issues) regarding our website.
But we also have new (research) [projects](https://github.com/GDI-foundation/website/projects) planned to which you are welcome to contribute. We are accepting new (board)members, volunteers and contributing partners.

#### Our current status
We are currently moving our entire infrastructure to a new secure platform.
