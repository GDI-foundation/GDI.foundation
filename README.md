#### What do we do?
We detect & analyze high risk "criminal" opportunities, share the risk & vulnerabilities with everybody, inform the ones who are at risk and give free advice about a solution. A few of our operations were covered in the [news](https://www.google.nl/search?q=GDI.foundation&num=100&tbs=sbd:1&tbm=nws&tbas=0&source=lnt&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi4sMS66qvdAhXGIlAKHdTxC-MQpwUIHw&biw=1440&bih=803&dpr=2).
