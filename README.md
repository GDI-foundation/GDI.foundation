#### GDI.Foundation is a nonprofit organization. 
Our mission is to defend the free & open Internet by trying to make it safer.
We address security issues with responsible disclosure ([coordinated vulnerability disclosures](https://www.iso.org/standard/45170.html)). *Did you know that the Dutch NCSC published their new [Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure Guideline](https://www.ncsc.nl/english/current-topics/news/coordinated-vulnerability-disclosure-guideline-supports-organisations-with-their-cvd-policy.html 
) very recently?*

#### What do we stand for?
We believe that actions must be taken to protect the freedom of communication through the Internet. This is our [mission statement](/mission/).

#### What do we do?
We detect & analyze high risk "criminal" opportunities, share the risk & vulnerabilities with everybody, inform the ones who are at risk and give free advice about a solution. A few of our operations were covered in the [news](https://www.google.nl/search?q=GDI.foundation&num=100&tbs=sbd:1&tbm=nws&tbas=0&source=lnt&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi4sMS66qvdAhXGIlAKHdTxC-MQpwUIHw&biw=1440&bih=803&dpr=2).

We have saved our previous publications [here](https://github.com/GDI-foundation/website/tree/master/archive).

#### Are we making a profit?
No, we are a nonprofit foundation. We rely on contributions in the form of donations, sponsorships and participating members

#### Can I help?
Yes. We have many [issues and missing features](https://github.com/GDI-foundation/website/issues/) regarding our website.
However, we also have new (research) [projects](https://github.com/GDI-foundation/website/projects/) planned to which you are welcome to contribute. We are accepting new (board)members, volunteers, and contributing partners.

#### Our current status
We are currently moving our entire infrastructure to a new secure platform. We are also interviewing several talented and enthusiastic people for several board member positions and run an election for selecting a new chair, vice-chair, treasurer and secretary from our members as we steadily go forward. In the next three months will be setting the [GCERT](https://github.com/GCERT) which make us more efficient in handling vulnerabilities and provide a systematic response facility to computer security threats and (online) incidents.
